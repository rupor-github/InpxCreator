### Generator of INPX (archive index) files for MyHomeLib

Home of MyHomeLib project is [here](http://home-lib.net/)

This is a simple tools collection to help you with keeping local MyHomeLib books collections in sync with remote servers. 
Project was originally hosted in subversion on [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/code/myhomelib/subversion/nodes/1178/Utils/InpxCreator) 
as part of MyHomeLib but due to various moves some of the history was lost, so I decided to detach it.

Enjoy!
