# InpxCreator
### Generator of INPX (archive index) files for MyHomeLib

Home of MyHomeLib project is [here](http://home-lib.net/)

This is a simple set of tools to help you with keeping local MyHomeLib books collections in sync with remote servers. 
Project was originally hosted in subversion on [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/code/myhomelib/subversion/nodes/1178/Utils/InpxCreator) 
as part of MyHomeLib but due to various moves some of the history was lost, so I decided to detach it.

Included programs (currently) do not perform any meaningful validation of archives or SQL information and deal with SQL dump modifications 
only when absolutly necessary (critical errors and such).

Enjoy!
